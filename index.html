<p> Sir Alex Ferguson (SAF) changed the dynamic of football management after his illustrious career came to an end in 2013. <br>
    SAF began his managerial career at age 32 with East Stirlingshire in a part time capacity for £40 a week, yet ended his career as the most decorated and successful manager in football history.<br>
    Enamoured by most, villified by his rivals - he has undoubtedly left behind a legacy which is unlikely to be surpassed.
